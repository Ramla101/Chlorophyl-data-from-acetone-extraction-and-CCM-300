# Chlorophyl data from acetone extraction and CCM-300
Accurate assessment of leaf chlorophyll is essential for understanding plant physiological responses to environmental variation. While solvent extraction provides precise chlorophyll concentrations, it is destructive and temporally limited. In contrast, portable optical meters such as the CCM-300 enable rapid, non-destructive measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (CFR), but their calibration against extracted pigments is often species- and season-specific. This study evaluated the reliability of CCM-300 measurements and reconstructed seasonal chlorophyll dynamics in Acer campestre across two contrasting summers in the United Kingdom.

## Data sets list
1. Comparision data between CCM-300 and acetone extracted values on same samples
2. 2022 season data taken with CCM-300
3. 2023 season data taken using 80% acetone based solvent extraction method
